You can add funds to your wallet by clicking the `+ Money` button.

All your actions like tweaking, backtesting, paper trading and real trading are charged according the funds in your wallet (wherever charges are applicable).

Your funds keep decreasing as and when you are charged, and once the funds become zero, your account stops trading.

If your actions are going to be quite extensive, then consider opting for packages/plans to get more economical benefits.
