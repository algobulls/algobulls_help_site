## Trade Manager

Enter your agent's details here if your AlgoBulls platform account will be managed by them.

!!! NOTE - 

    Please do not share your AlgoBulls credentials with your agent. Once you add your agent details here, the agent gets a separate set of credentials with limited account access to manage your trades.
    
    AlgoBulls will not be responsible for any issues occurring because of deliberate or leaked credentials of your account.
