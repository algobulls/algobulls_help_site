# Settings

In Settings, you can add/edit your basic profile, update your KYC information, set your trading risk, grant access to your trading manager, and explore your developer options.

Choose the Setting options from the sidebar navigation. 

The Settings section is divided into 4 parts: 

## Personal Info

`Bio` - A short About Me section that allows us to learn more about you and interact with you suitably. Any links to your LinkedIn profile or other social media accounts are also beneficial.

WARNING -  Uploading incorrect KYC details (Aadhar / PAN) will lead to de-activation of your account. Please contact your relationship manager or email us to get your account reactivated.

Any packages or payments made to the AlgoBulls platform will remain in effect during the deactivation period and cannot be redeemed or extended.

## Password & Security
You can edit your password and check other security options here 


## Trade Manager
Enter your agent's details here if your AlgoBulls platform account will be managed by them.

!!! NOTE - 

    Please do not share your AlgoBulls credentials with your agent. Once you add your agent details here, the agent gets a separate set of credentials with limited account access to manage your trades.
    
    AlgoBulls will not be responsible for any issues occurring because of deliberate or leaked credentials of your account.
