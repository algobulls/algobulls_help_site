!!! note

    * Please note that you will be charged for using these services.

    * To waive these charges, you can purchase a package with AlgoBulls.

!!! warning

    Even after completing all the preceding steps, trading may not begin for the following reasons:

    * Insufficient funds in your broker account.
    * A particular segment in your broker account has not been activated (this can happen with new accounts; some brokers activate this by default, while others may take 24 hours or more).
    * Due to market volatility, your broker may stop accepting certain order requests on some scripts or stocks. If any such order type with such script/stock strategy is currently running in your AlgoBulls account, new orders for the same won't be displayed.
    * Certain order types may be incompatible with certain brokers.
    * Your linked broker account must allow you to execute those orders. Not all strategies are accepted/allowed by every broker due to permission issues.
    * The AlgoBulls platform has no control over the brokerage charges imposed by your broker once your trading begins. Please review all charges on the broker's end before proceeding.
