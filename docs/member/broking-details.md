!!! note
    
    A broker binding cannot be unbinded if trades are in progress. (Example, during market hours) Stop all your running strategies and then unbind a broker.
    
    Any one broker at a given time can be binded. Binding a broker will automatically remove the bind of any other broker, if the current binded broker is not being used by the platform.
    
    If no broker is present, all trading will be stopped.
    
    If no broker is binded, all trading will be stopped.
    
    If a broker is binded but the platform trading limit has matched the funds in your broker account, all trading will be stopped.
