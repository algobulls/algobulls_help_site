# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. General

### i. What is AlgoBulls? How does AlgoBulls work?

AlgoBulls is a cutting-edge trading platform that offers 100% automated trading algorithms. It allows users to deploy multiple trading strategies for various asset classes such as Equity, Commodities, Futures & Options, and Currency across multiple
exchanges like NSE, BSE, and MCX. Clients can choose which algorithmic strategies they want to follow and engage in auto trading, or they can have their customised trading strategies developed as algorithms and deployed in live markets via the
AlgoBulls platform. The AlgoBulls platform supports multiple brokers, and clients can integrate their broker if it is not already listed.

### ii. Do you need any technical knowledge or can anyone start?

Absolutely not! Our automated trading platform connects with your trading account, and expert algorithmic strategies handle all the trading and risk management for you. No prior experience in trading or programming is required.

### iii. Does it work in a bearish market?

Yes, AlgoBulls utilises multiple trading strategies designed to profit during a falling market (bear market) through the use of short selling or inverse positions.

### iv. How much capital is necessary for trading?

Each method provides information on the minimum capital required for that specific stock. However, the required capital depends on two factors: the quantity you wish to trade and the leverage provided by your broker for that specific stock.

### v. What are the risk-to-reward ratio and accuracy rates?

We provide backtesting data for all our strategies on the Odyssey platform so you can evaluate each strategy's performance. The summary section contains information on the number of trades, profit, losses, hit ratio, and other relevant factors.
