You can add funds to your wallet by clicking the `+ Add Money` button.

All your actions like tweaking, backtesting, paper trading and real trading are charged according to the funds in your wallet (wherever charges are applicable).

Your funds keep decreasing as and when you are charged, and once the funds become zero, your account stops trading.

If your actions are going to be quite extensive, then consider opting for packages/plans to get more economical benefits.

There are 3 tabs here:

`Plan` - A category-wise list of packages offering by the platform.

`Active Plans` - The currently active plan(s) in your account.

`History` - A list of all amounts that you have added to your wallet over a period of time.

## Models

* Subscription Model
