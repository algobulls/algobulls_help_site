## Models

The AlgoBulls platform works on 2 models: Pay-per-use model & Subscription model 

* `Pay-per-use Model`: You deposit funds into your AlgoBulls Wallet in this model. You are charged for various services that you use.This may include backtesting, paper trading, tweaking strategies and more. To keep track of the usage costs, always check your Fund Book in the Live reports section.

### Plans for the Pay-per-use Model

| Action                                                   | Cost |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Run backtesting for a tweaked strategy                   | <font size=6>ðŸ’°</font> Rs. 1/min   |
| Run paper trading for a strategy                         | <font size=6>ðŸ’°</font> Rs. 1/min    |
| Run real trading for a strategy                          | <font size=6>ðŸ’°</font>    |

To know the charges for Real Trading, you have to check the â€˜Transaction fee (w/o package) section in the strategy details as shown below:

* `Subscription Model`: 
In this model you choose a package of your choice from the plans & wallets sections for a specific time duration. Hence all services included in the package will not incur any additional charges for that period. 

Hereâ€™s an example to help you understand better: 
If you activate a plan for Backtesting services for 3000 INR for 30 days (max 10K minutes), you will be able to use the service without incurring any further expenses for the next 30 days.
However for Real Trading, the subscription selected by you does not include this service. This means Real Trading service will continue to be charged according to the Pay-per-use Model. 

### Plans for the Subscription Model

| Action                                                   | Cost |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------|
| Add a strategy from Marketplace to your Portfolio        | <font size=6>ðŸ†“</font>  |
| View backtesting reports for a strategy from Marketplace | <font size=6>ðŸ†“</font>   |
| Tweak (change parameters of) a strategy                  | <font size=6>ðŸ†“</font>   |

Ensure you keep a track of the usage costs by checking the Fund Book. You can add money or subscribe to a plan from the Plans and Wallet section
