# AlgoBulls Help

![Logo](imgs/algobulls_logo_with_tagline.svg)

## Introduction
Welcome! We think you should go through the list below and see that you have understood and ticked off all the points!

## 1) Broking Account
You need to have a valid working broking account before you start algorithmic trading using AlgoBulls.

We currently offer support for the following brokers. (More on the way!)

* Aliceblue
* Mastertrust
* Zerodha
* Upstox

Make sure you sign up and setup your account with any of these brokers before proceeding further, as you will need to provide those details to AlgoBulls to [link it](member/Operations/broking-account) with the broking account.

## 2) Registration and Sign-Up
Once you have a valid working broking account, kindly register with AlgoBulls and complete the sign-up process.

After you login, you land [here](member/landing-page).

## 3) Your Wallet
After you login, you need to add funds to your [Wallet](member/your-wallet).

Your transactions are charged through the wallet. All charges are detailed in the [Fundbook](member/Operations/fundbook).

## 4) Profile
Now that you have added funds, kindly fill the [Profile](member/Operations/profile) page.

This page helps you to give details like Aadhar ID, PAN, etc. which are required as per the governmental regulations for trading online.

## 5) Portfolio

The most important area of AlgoBulls is the [Portfolio](member/Operations/portfolio) page.

All strategies created/opted by you can be viewed, tweaked, started and stopped from here.

All activities triggered at the Portfolio page can be viewed in the [Tradebook](member/Operations/tradebook).

All recent activities are also a part of your Notifications, which you can see by pressing the bell icon on the [Landing Page](member/landing-page).

## 6) Build your own Strategy

You can create very complex and customizable strategies on the [Build](member/build-your-strategy) page using conditions, indicators, instruments and candlesticks.

You can always take your pick from the millions of tailor-made strategies made by our experts also (which you can tweak from the Portfolio page to suit your needs).

## 7) Favorites

Finally, you can choose some strategies as [Favorites](member/Operations/favorites), which is a handy way to keep an eye on some of the strategies.
