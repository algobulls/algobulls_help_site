# AlgoBulls Help

![Logo](imgs/algobulls_logo_with_tagline.svg)

## Introduction
Welcome! We think you should go through the list below and see that you have understood and ticked off all the points!

## 1) Registration and Sign-Up
Visit [the site](https://www.algobulls.com/) and sign-up to the AlgoBulls platform.

## 2) General Settings
After signing up to the platform, visit [here](member/Settings/general-settings.md) to know more about updating your KYC details.

Your KYC details like Aadhar ID, PAN, etc. are required as per the governmental regulations for trading online.

## 3) Add funds into your Algobulls account
Click [here](member/wallet.md) to know more about your Wallet. All pricing, packages and adding funds into your Algobulls account are covered here.


## 4) Update your trading risk
Click [here](member/Settings/general-settings.md) to know more about updating your trading risk.

Trading Risk is the amount till which the AlgoBulls platform should execute your trade.

Example, if you have 100,000 in your broker account and you enter your trading risk amount as 80,000, then AlgoBulls will keep firing trades through your broker account till the funds in your broker account reach 80,000.

On reaching 80,000, all trading will stop.

Example, if you have 100,000 in your broker account and you enter your trading risk amount as 120,000, then AlgoBulls will not start trading, as the amount in your broker account is already less than the acceptable risk amount. 

## 5) Broker Account and Binding

You need to have a valid working broking account before you start algorithmic trading using AlgoBulls.

We currently offer support for the following brokers. (More on the way!)

* Zerodha
* Mastertrust
* Aliceblue
* Upstox

Make sure you sign up and setup your account with any of these brokers before proceeding further, as you will need to provide those details to AlgoBulls to [bind it](member/Settings/broking-settings) with the broking account.

!!! tldr
    All the above points are the minimum actions you need to take to start algorithmic trading with the AlgoBulls platform.
    
!!! note
    If your trading has still not started, look at the possible reasons below. Please contact your relationship manager if you think there is another reason as to why your trading has not started. Alternatively, you can [Email us]().
    
!!! warning
    Even after completing the all the points mentioned above, trading might not start because of the follwing reasons:
    
    * Your broker account may not have sufficient funds
    
    * Currency Segment in your broker account is not yet activated. (This happens with new accounts, and though Zerodha activates this by default, Alice Blue takes 24 hours to do so)
    
    * Due to market volatility, your broker may have stopped taking bracket order requests. (Any bracket order strategies currently running in your platform account will stop showing any new orders)
    
    * Certain order types dont work with certain brokers. So your binded broker account should allow those particular order to be fired.
    
    * Every strategy may not run with every broker. This is due to permission issues at the broker end.
    
    * Once your trading starts, the AlgoBulls platform has no control over the brokerage charges levied by your broker. Please have a look at all charges on the broker side before going ahead.
