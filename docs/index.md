!!! warning
    Even after completing the all the points mentioned above, trading might not start because of the following reasons:
    
    * Your broker account may not have sufficient funds
    
    * Any specific segment in your broker account is not yet activated. (This happens with new accounts, and though some brokers activate this by default, others may take 24 hours or more to do so)
    
    * Due to market volatility, your broker may have stopped taking certain order requests on some of the scripts or stock.(If any such order type with such script/stock strategies currently running in your platform account will stop showing any new orders)
    
    * Certain order types don't work with certain brokers. So your binded broker account should allow those particular order to be fired
    
    * Every strategy may not run with every broker. This is due to permission issues at the broker end
    
    * Once your trading starts, the AlgoBulls platform has no control over the brokerage charges levied by your broker. Please have a look at all charges on the broker side before going ahead
