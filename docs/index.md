## Introduction
Welcome! We think you should go through the list below and see that you have understood and ticked off all the points!

## Before you start
---
* Customers looking to do only Backtesting and Paper Trading can do the `Registration and Sign-Up` step and `Add funds into your AlgoBulls account` step given below.

* Customers looking to do Real Trading on Indian Markets and Exchanges will need to tick-off all steps given below.

## 1) Registration and Sign-Up
Visit [the site](https://www.algobulls.com/) and sign-up to the AlgoBulls platform.

## 2) Add funds into your AlgoBulls account
Click [here](member/wallet.md) to know more about your Wallet. All pricing, packages and adding funds into your AlgoBulls account are covered here.

## 3) General Settings
After signing up to the platform, visit [here](member/Settings/general-settings.md) to know more about updating your KYC details.

Your KYC details like Aadhar ID, PAN, etc. are required as per the governmental regulations for trading online.

!!! Note
    * You can skip this step if you are looking to do Backtesting and Paper Trading (**but not Real Trading**)

## 4) Update your Risk Management Settings (Beta)
Click [here](/member/Settings/general-settings/#risk-management) to know more about your Risk Management Settings.

`MAX Capital Drawdown` is your Risk Appetite. Real Trading will stop when this limit is breached.

`Desired Profit` is the value of your Profit Limit. Real Trading will stop when this value is achieved.

!!! Note
    * You can skip this step if you are looking to do Backtesting and Paper Trading (**but not Real Trading**)

## 5) Broker Account and Binding

You need to have a valid working broking account before you start algorithmic trading using AlgoBulls.

We currently offer support for the following brokers. (More on the way!)

* Alice Blue
* Zerodha
* Mastertrust

Make sure you sign up and setup your account with any of these brokers before proceeding further, as you will need to provide those details to AlgoBulls to [bind it](member/Settings/broking-settings) with the broking account.

!!! Note
    * You can skip this step if you are looking to do Backtesting and Paper Trading (**but not Real Trading**)

If your trading has still not started, look at the possible reasons below. Please contact your relationship manager if you think there is another reason as to why your trading has not started. Alternatively, you can [email us](mailto:support@algobulls.com).
    
!!! warning
    Even after completing the all the points mentioned above, trading might not start because of the following reasons:
    
    * Your broker account may not have sufficient funds
    
    * Currency Segment in your broker account is not yet activated. (This happens with new accounts, and though some brokers activate this by default, others may take takes 24 hours or more to do so)
    
    * Due to market volatility, your broker may have stopped taking bracket order requests. (Any bracket order strategies currently running in your platform account will stop showing any new orders)
    
    * Certain order types don't work with certain brokers. So your binded broker account should allow those particular order to be fired.
    
    * Every strategy may not run with every broker. This is due to permission issues at the broker end.
    
    * Once your trading starts, the AlgoBulls platform has no control over the brokerage charges levied by your broker. Please have a look at all charges on the broker side before going ahead.
