Introduction","text":"<p>Fixed income is an investment that focuses on capital and income preservation. It frequently includes investments such as government and corporate bonds/NSDs/MLDs. Fixed income can provide a consistent stream of income while posing less risk than stocks. If you are just entering the world of investment, bonds, NCDs &amp; MLDs can be a great place to begin! So let\u2019s understand what are Bonds, NCDs &amp; MLDs and how investing in these securities can be beneficial for you?</p> <p>BONDS: A bond is a financial instrument that allows individuals to lend money to institutions such as governments or businesses. The institution will pay a set interest rate on the investment for the duration of the bond, then return the original amount at the end of the loan's term. Bond investing provides a predictable income stream, and in many cases, bonds pay interest multiple times in a year. Since the investor receives the entire principal amount if the bond is held until maturity, these are regarded as the best way to protect one's capital.</p> <p>NCDs: NCDs are Non-convertible Debentures. Companies use non-convertible debentures as a tool to raise long-term capital through a public issue. When compared to convertible debentures, lenders typically receive a higher rate of return to compensate for the disadvantage of non-convertibility. NCDs also provide the owner with a number of additional advantages, including increased liquidity due to their listing on the stock market, source tax exemptions, and safety due to the fact that only companies with strong credit ratings are permitted to issue NCDs in accordance with RBI-established guidelines.</p> <p>MLDs: MLDs are Market Linked Debentures. MLDs are non-convertible debentures with variable returns that are correlated to the market. The performance of the underlying index affects the return from a Market Linked Debenture.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s understand how you can begin trading on the AlgoBulls Fixed Income marketplace.</p>"},{"location":"member/fixed-income.html#2-an-overview","title":"2.
