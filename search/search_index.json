Different broking accounts need different details, and this page helps you to supply those details according to the broking account of your choice! Note Only one broker account can be bound to the platform account at any given time. The AlgoBulls platform account will use the binded broker account to fire your trades. We consider 1 example below: Zerodha Add a Broker \u00b6 Click on the Add button to add a new broker account. Select a broker of your choice. For our example, we select Zerodha.
